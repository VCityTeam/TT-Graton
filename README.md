Render a graph in 3D within a threejs scene, with a D3 force layout.
Still need to find an aesthetical way to organize all this data...

## Running things
```bash
npm install
npm start   # And answer yep when asked about http.server installation
```
Then browse the proposed URL.

## TODO
* Propose a format style in order to avoid lint/prettier commit wars.
